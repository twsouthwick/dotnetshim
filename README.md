# .NET Runtime shim

This project is an example of how a different runtime can be hosted than the run being run. There are two examples:

1. `net35host.exe` Starts up the .NET 4.0 runtime and runs a method in a .NET 4.5 targeted library
2. `net45host.exe` Starts up the .NET 2.0 runtime and runs a method in a .NET 3.5 targeted library
